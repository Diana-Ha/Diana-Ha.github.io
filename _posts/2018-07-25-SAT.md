**Goal:**
<br>
How to improve SAT exam participation rates

**Data Provided:**
SAT (filename: "sat.csv") and ACT (filename: "act.csv") scores and participation rates by state for the graduating class of 2017

**Data Sources**
SAT: <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent"> https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent </a>
<br>
ACT: <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows"> https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows </a>

**My Process**
<br>This project is primarily focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via visualizations and NumPy. As you go through my notebook on GitHub, you will see that the majority of the cells are used for EDA. In the last part of my notebook, I perform hypethesis tests to determine the true means of ACT and SAT participation rates, which did not yield surprising results. 

**Final Recommendations**
<br> My two main recommendations given the data provided is that the College Board should:
1. Partner with more states to provide free tests
2. Emphasize the benefits and brand of the SAT relative to the ACT
<br> For more details, please visit my GitHub (link above) and read the file named "SAT.pdf".
