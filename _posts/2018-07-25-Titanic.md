title: Analyzing Titanic Survival Rates
---

This project focuses on analyzing Titanic survivor data from Kaggle using Pandas and visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn).

**A couple of things before we get started:**
<br>
- To view the data dictionary detailing the descriptions of each column, go here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data"> https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data </a>
- The data required to run my notebook has already been downloaded and is titled "train.csv".
- All cells have been annotated, describing what I am trying to do or display and (if applicable) commenting on the output of that cell

**My Process**
<br>
In terms of work flow, I started by reviewing the data (specifically focusing on nulls or missing data), cleaning the data, performing some feature extractions, and then exploring the data to answer the following questions:

- What was the survival rate overall?
- Which gender fared the worst? What was their survival rate?
- What was the survival rate for each Pclass?
- Did any reverends survive? How many?
- What is the survival rate for cabins marked ¯\(ツ)/¯
- What is the survival rate for people whose Age is empty?
- What is the survival rate for each port of embarkation?
- What is the survival rate for children (under 12) in each Pclass?
- Did the captain of the ship survive? Is he on the list?
- Of all the people that died, who had the most expensive ticket? How much did it cost?
- Does having family on the boat help or hurt your chances of survival?

**Results and Findings**
<br>
If you have gone through my notebook, you will notice (based on both the numerical outputs and the visualizations) that if you were a man on the Titanic, your chances of survival were slim, regardless of your boarding class, age, port of embarkation, etc.
